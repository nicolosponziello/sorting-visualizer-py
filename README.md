## Sorting algorithms visualizer made with Python and tkinter

This application is based on the architectural pattern MVC.

- Model (M): contains the business logic of the application, in this case the array, its generation and the sorting method
- Controller (C): manages the interaction between the Model and the View
- View (V): made with tkinter, draw stuff and controls on the screen. It receives input from the user and send commands to the controller

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
